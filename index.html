        <h5 class="card-header">About Me</h5>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">I'm an 19 year old programmer from Seattle, Washington.</p>
            <p class="card-text">I'm currently a student at Northeastern University, studying Computer
                Engineering. My future aspirations are to work on spaceflight, bringing science back to Earth and humans
                closer to the stars.</p>
            <p class="card-text">I first took an interest in programming from playing Minecraft. I started programming
                initially out of desire to recreate something like the survival games from The Hive servers. I never did
                actually get around to doing that. As a matter of fact, I've completed maybe 2 actual published
                <a href="https://dev.bukkit.org/members/_ForgeUser10992836/projects">Bukkit plugins</a>. Regardless, I
                think that I've come a long way since 2013. Although programming was more or less of a side activity
                when I first started, I've realized that it's become much more than that for me.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="card" style="margin-top: 30px">
        <h5 class="card-header">What I Do</h5>
        <div class="card-body">
            <p class="card-text">I have 7 years of experience working with the Java language. I try to do a little bit
                of everything, whether it be GUI design, building APIs, writing applications, Bukkit plugins, 3D games,
                you name it. Most of my work is published on GitHub, at least the ones I think are worth publishing.</p>
            <p class="card-text">The vast majority of what I do involves Minecraft in some way. I contribute to a few
                open-source projects, such as the <a href="https://github.com/EssentialsX/Essentials">EssentialsX</a>
                project and smaller APIs some of my friends have written.</p>
            <p class="card-text">I think many people will probably have heard of me from either the
                Bukkit Forums (the account to which I inadvertently deleted a bit back) or the
                <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/members/xtrollxdudex.6621/">SpigotMC Forums</a>. Since I'm not
                terribly good at coming up with project ideas, I like to browse the forums to look for interesting
                problems that other developers run into. There's a particular thrill with having to get your hands dirty
                and having to look around the server source code. Writing a short, elegant solution is just the cherry
                on top. I help other people solve their problems, people can benefit from reading the source code and
                picking up on what I've learned, and I get a blast of dopamine from doing some detective work.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Although I've dabbled into a wide array of different projects, I am especially
                passionate about investigating performance and analyzing multithreaded programs. I think that your code
                shouldn't just look good, it should be fast and safe as well. It's always interesting to see lock-free
                data structures or looking at how other people have worked around different obstacles to optimize
                their program.</p>
            <p class="card-text">I've also done some work involving the C and C++ languages. It feels liberating to be
                able to use lower-level constructs and writing closer to the hardware once one is used to writing
                high-level Java abstractions all the time.</p>
            <p>I'm familiar as well with HTML, but I need a lot of hand-holding to work through it. I don't really take
                a particular interest in web languages, and the look of my website is just an unfortunate side effect
                from that.</p>

        <h5 class="card-header">My Work</h5>
        <div class="card-body">
            <h5 class="card-title">Professional Experience</h5>
            <ul>
                <li class="card-text">I currently work at ExodusPrisons.</li>
                <li class="card-text">I am a former Developer at SpaceDelta. I wrote and did the majority of maintenance
                    for the species plugin. I left in September 2019 because of disagreements I had with management.
                </li>
                <li class="card-text">I am a former Developer at Skytropia. The project was abandoned and the remnants
                were transferred to ExodusPrisons.</li>
                <li class="card-text">I am a former Senior Software Developer at Intermissum Limited. I worked for a
                    time on the reboot of the HCGames server, CryptoMC, as well as the highly successful
                    <a href="https://www.minesaga.org/">MineSaga</a> server network. I wrote the original minions
                    plugin, the generators plugin, the kits plugin, the gambling plugin, the original bosses plugin, and
                    worked on several other plugins that I can't even name off the top of my head. I also worked on
                    server performance, and made major modifications to the server jar to optimize the player
                    experience. I left in January 2019 to pursue my own interests, and returned in September 2019 to
                    assist development for a short time.
                </li>
                <li class="card-text">I also did some preliminary work for the
                    <a href="https://pm-mc.com/">Project Mayhem</a> network prior to it shutting down. The server came
                    back a few months later and had great success, although I did not was not involved with it the
                    second time around.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h5 class="card-title">Current Works</h5>
            <ul>
                <li class="card-text">My top priority is always getting my job done first and foremost. After that, I'll
                    often work on other projects. Since I'm currently working, that doesn't leave much time for myself,
                    but I do try my best.
                </li>
                <li class="card-text">When I get the time, I work on my blog, linked above, on the side. I am a firm
                    believer that one should always be adapting, moving forward, and learning new things on a consistent
                    basis. I think that having overcome many problems in the world of software development, it is my
                    duty to pass on some of what I've learned so that I can help other people learn as well. I don't
                    think that I'm a big-time blogger or anything, but if the odd someone who either has the same
                    problem as I, or someone who wants to learn more stumbles upon my blog out of the blue, I would
                    consider that mission accomplished. Like I always say, you already proved that you are mildly
                    interested by getting this far into the thick of whatever I'm writing, so it can't hurt to also look
                    at whatever else I've written as well, since you couldn't be bothered to spend your time doing
                    something else of course :)
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h5 class="card-title">Recent Works</h5>
            <ul>
                <li class="card-text">I've also been working on this particular project,
                    <a href="https://github.com/AgentTroll/pbft-java"><code>pbft-java</code></a> for a long time. I
                    actually had a lot more work done in 2018, but I recently decided to remove everything and start
                    from scratch again in 2019. I over-thought the design, and didn't consider usability in the place of
                    flexibility. Trying to conform to the protocol established by the PBFT whitepaper is one of the
                    challenges I'm familiar with from working on the TridentSDK project, it's just that this time, I
                    don't really have anything to test with to make sure I did everything right.
                </li>
                <li class="card-text">One of the more recent projects I've published is the
                    <a href="https://github.com/AgentTroll/instant-skull"><code>instantskull</code></a> project to
                    resolve an issue with player skulls not being updated on the clients side. This inspired by a
                    question on the SpigotMC Forums, and I enjoyed being able to write the
                    <a href="https://github.com/AgentTroll/lagger"><code>lagger</code></a> project to help me out in the
                    process of debugging the problem as well.
                </li>
                <li class="card-text">I am particularly pleased with the
                    <a href="https://github.com/AgentTroll/calamity"><code>calamity</code></a> project, which I wrote to
                    help reduce the complexity of writing an accumulating buffer. I succeeded in writing a highly
                    modular API that I can use in the future in case I need a <code>ByteArrayOutputStream</code>. By
                    reducing the amount of garbage produced to buffer bytes and transfer them for encoding or decoding,
                    I believe I can write lower latency networked applications in the future.
                </li>
                <li class="card-text">One of my C projects is the
                    <a href="https://github.com/AgentTroll/fate"><code>fate</code></a> project that I wrote to track
                    objects in orbit around Earth. Because the Air Force publishes datasets that track the location of
                    objects around earth in TLE format, I read up on the Space Track report and decoded that information
                    to determine the position of objects in the sky. I was hoping that I could use this to connect to my
                    telescope somehow, but I have so far been too lazy to get around to that.
                </li>
                <li class="card-text">Finally, another Java project that I think turned out well is my
                    <a href="https://github.com/AgentTroll/molarmass"><code>molarmass</code></a> project. I was really
                    frustrated by having to look up the masses of each individual element on the Periodic Table all the
                    time to complete my Chemistry assignments, so I decided to write a little tool to help me out. The
                    JSON parsing part to get all the mass data downloaded from the Internet was relatively trivial, but
                    my best work is in decoding the actual elements from the input. I thought that the state machine
                    design and the treeified form of the molecular formula was especially clever. I was also able to
                    use <a href="https://cucumber.io/">Cucumber</a> to perform behavioral testing on it, which I found
                    to be an interesting take on the development process.
                </li>
                <li class="card-text">I can't put everything that I've done into a single webpage, so if you are
                    interested in checking me out, you can browse the README files for all of my projects by clicking on
                    my GitHub link at the top of the page.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h5 class="card-title">Early Works</h5>
            <ul>
                <li class="card-text">One of my earliest works was
                    <a href="https://github.com/AgentTroll/TNTIgnite">TNTIgnite</a>, a plugin I wrote to learn the
                    Bukkit API. This was followed by my attempt to write a
                    <a href="https://bitbucket.org/AgentTroll/battledome">Battle Dome</a> plugin, which failed
                    spectacularly.
                </li>
                <li class="card-text">I believe my first real work that was of decent quality was the
                    <a href="https://github.com/AgentTroll/TrollCommons">BukkitCommons</a> library, now called
                    TrollCommons. I was really proud of the work that I did in performance testing collections and
                    reflection. I wrote a post talking about it on the Bukkit Forums
                    <a href="https://bukkit.org/threads/bukkitcommons-commons-library-for-bukkit-utils.301356/">here</a>.
                </li>
                <li class="card-text">In 2014, I dropped almost every Bukkit project to work on the
                    <a href="https://github.com/TridentSDK">TridentSDK project.</a> This turned out to be not as
                    successful as the team had hoped, and it's been more or less abandoned since I left the project to
                    work at Intermissum in 2017. I learned a significant lot about the Java language, including the
                    networking internals, multithreading, and performance testing during my time working on TridentSDK.
                    In addition, the experience working with the protocol as well as learning how the Mojang team solved
                    problems with their server in recreating the Minecraft server was a valuable learning experience for
                    me.
